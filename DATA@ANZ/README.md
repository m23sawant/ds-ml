# Data@ANZ Virtual Internship Program

Data@ANZ is about mining and linking datasets to develop stories that matter and challenge the status quo, to deliver on ANZ’s purpose “to shape a world where people and communities thrive”.

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Segment the dataset and draw unique insights, including visualisation of the transaction volume and assessing the effect of any outliers.

This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.

The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data, so many of the insights gathered from the tasks will be genuine.

## Task 2: Predictive Analytics
Explore correlations between customer attributes, build a regression and a decision-tree prediction model based on your findings.

Using the same transaction dataset, identify the annual salary for each customer

Explore correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes (e.g. age). These attributes could be those that are readily available in the data (e.g. age) or those that you construct or derive yourself (e.g. those relating to purchasing behaviour). Visualise any interesting correlations using a scatter plot.

Build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes you identified above.
